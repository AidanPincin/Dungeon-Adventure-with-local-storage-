I don't really know what to put here but here goes nothing.
I tried out coding in the past through scratch and hour code but i never took interest.
7 months ago my mom made me take an introduction to coding class on python
At first i didnt like it. there was no coding for the first month, just learning about people who were an important
part of programming and the first languages  like FORTRAN and BASIC.
but when i actually started coding in VS code i quikly took interest and went vary far ahead in coding and within a month i was already making my first game
and with 2 parents as software engineers they were there to help when i couldn't figure out something
and I thank my mom for getting me into programming
3 months after i started programming I finished my first ever graphics game in python. you can check it out in my python repository.
When i saw there was a spring class called Independant study- technology spring which was about 
laerning linux i decided to join. I showed the teacher the python game i made and she was very impressed and decided to put me in this competition/club
despite the registration closing a long time ago.
after that i decided to get into javascript, HTML, and CSS so i could make websites and share my games much easier
It was very hard at first and then i discovered something called canvas that allowed me to drop CSS altogether and code in only javascript
Which made it much easier for me. This entire journey has been a huge learning process and has definetly made me a better debugger.
And i couldn't have done it without the support of my parents so I thank them very much.
